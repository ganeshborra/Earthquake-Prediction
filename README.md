# Earthquake-Prediction
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting earthquakes using historical earthquake data. The dataset contains features such as Date, Time, Latitude, Longitude, Depth, Magnitude, Magnitude Type, Event ID, Source, and other related seismic parameters.

The goal of this project is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques to:

Understand seismic data patterns

Visualize earthquake trends across time and location

Predict earthquake likelihood based on input features

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

Date (YYYY/MM/DD) – Earthquake date

Time – Time of occurrence
